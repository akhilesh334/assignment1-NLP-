This project file contain python file and report gives overview about assignment and about 1D CNN. 
Report paper is about predicting median house value using longitude, latitude, housing median age, the total number of rooms, the total number of bedrooms, population, number of households, and median income.   based on a housing dataset using 1D Convolution Neural Network. This dataset` contains one row per census block group.  This dataset is all the information about houses in California. 1-D CNN is so effective where you can derive interesting features from the fixed-length segments of the entire dataset and location of it is within the segment which is not of high relevance. This paper deals with getting a subplot graph with MSE and R\^2.
